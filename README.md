## üéØ Problem Statement

Major AMMs (Raydium, Orca, Meteora) don't support Token-2022 with transfer hooks, creating a significant barrier for regulated assets, RWAs (Real World Assets), and any tokens requiring programmable transfer restrictions. This limits DeFi adoption for compliant tokenized assets.

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

Built a complete AMM that natively supports Token-2022 with transfer hooks, featuring:

- **Hook Validation System:** Secure whitelist-based approval for transfer hooks
- **Complete Trading Infrastructure:** Full swap, liquidity provision, and pool management
- **Security-First Design:** Pre-transaction validation prevents failed trades
- **Developer-Friendly:** Clean API and comprehensive documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

**Smart Contracts**

- **token22-swap:** Main AMM program with hook validation and trading logic
- **whitelist-hook:** Example transfer hook implementing KYC/whitelist functionality
