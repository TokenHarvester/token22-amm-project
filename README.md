## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Major AMMs (Raydium, Orca, Meteora) don't support Token-2022 with transfer hooks, creating a significant barrier for regulated assets, RWAs (Real World Assets), and any tokens requiring programmable transfer restrictions. This limits DeFi adoption for compliant tokenized assets.
